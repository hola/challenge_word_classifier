Sorry for the delay! We are done testing the participants' solutions, presenting preliminary results below. Why are these “preliminary”? Because we can be wrong. We hope not, but if someone can point out how our results are incorrect, there's still time to revisit them. Comments are welcome!

Final results, with participants' names instead of submission IDs, will be announced on **June 20, 2016**. We are also going to post a separate article that gives proper consideration to those solutions that learn, comparing them to each other.

## About the test set

All solutions were tested on 10,000 blocks of 100 words each, generated by the [testcase generator](03-testing-progress.md#testcase-generator) using the [official testcase sequence](03-testing-progress.md#the-official-testcase-sequence). Here are a few facts about the test set.

| Subset            | Words   | Share  | Examples                                                          |

| All nonwords      | 499,328 | 49.93% |                                                                   |
| Nonwords, model 0 |  92,206 |  9.22% | ha'pjcnvcekpmexvsswbzfoq'k, qh'whqpmowhukjjgxwinajyk, leysazuyabs |

| Nonwords, model 2 |  74,631 |  7.46% | coterfnicurly, wileberwalinteller's, grahablens                   |
| Nonwords, model 3 |  78,793 |  7.88% | fluiajalorium's, theral, cryophy                                  |

| Nonwords, model 5 |  56,814 |  5.68% | ostenderstated, smuckers, kettless                                |
| Nonwords, model 6 |  30,604 |  3.06% | portlige, celioelectrochemical's, runlessen                       |
| Nonwords, model 7 |  14,427 |  1.44% | ultrapatriot's, acocantheridiida, counterforms                    |
| Nonwords, model 8 |   7,213 |  0.72% | gynogenetical, prepalaeolithy, oxynaphthalene                     |

Nonwords from high-order Markov models are significantly more rare in the test set than those from low-order models. This is due to the particular algorithm the test generator uses: if a generated nonword happens to be in the dictionary, it is discarded, and a new nonword is generated, possibly from a different model. Because the output of high-order models very closely resembles English, this happens to them much more often. We decided not to correct for this phenomenon, and have low-similarity nonwords dominate the set.

A few people asked why the dictionary was so weird, with many “words” that you wouldn't normally think of as English. Here is why. There are only so many words in English (and any other language). Dictionaries normally used in spellcheckers range [between 50,000 and 165,000 words](http://wordlist.aspell.net/scowl-readme/). We could have picked, say, 165,000 words, which is on the large side of what can reasonably be called “an English dictionary”. With 64 KiB size limit, it would most likely be possible to fit the entire compressed dictionary in the quota and achieve 100% correctness. This wouldn't be acceptable because then we would be unable to decide between many contestants who achieved 100%. This means that the quota would have to be reduced accordingly, to 16 KiB or even smaller. But for such small sizes, efficient minification of the code itself (and not just data compression) becomes a concern, and we didn't want this to become mainly a code minification contest. For this reason, we went for the biggest dictionary we could find: the “insane” version of the SCOWL, which includes ridiculously rare terminology, seldom-used spelling variants, and even some nonexistent words generated by stemming. Even the biggest reasonable spelling dictionary is less than a quarter of this, which means that at least 3 in 4 words in our wordlist are not what you would call an English word. Still, these are not entirely random, and still share many statistical properties with English proper. We decided to compromise on this dictionary to achieve an interesting balance.

## Preliminary standings

We received 603 submissions from 312 unique participants. Only the last submission from each participant was tested.

### Main standings table

Excluded from this table are submissions that crashed, hanged, or were too slow to complete testing.

Legend:

* **Correct**: correctness rate (this is what the competition is about)
* **F–**: rate of false negatives
* **F+**: rate of false positives
* **F+<sub>0</sub>**…**F+<sub>8</sub>**: rate of false positives among words generated from a particular model
* *hc*: submissions *hors concours* (off-contest)

Solutions that haven't been assigned a rank in the leftmost column of this table, were evaluated off-contest for several reasons, such as having been submitted by Hola employees or requiring a fix to run (author forgot the “gzip” checkbox when submitting).

### Slow solutions

Three solutions were too slow to be tested with 10,000 blocks in reasonable time. They have been tested on fewer blocks, so their results are approximate, and they could not be ranked precisely with the others. As of this writing, they are still running on one of our servers. If it doesn't need to reboot before the testing completes, these solutions will eventually be moved to the main table above.

### Failing solutions

The remaining solutions failed in one way or another. With the exception of the two solutions that hang on a certain input, all crashes happened on initialization or first word classification attempt, and could have been prevented with the help of the [test program](../tests/test.js) we published during the contest.

### Raw results

The tables above have been generated from the raw results produced by the [production test system](../tests/test2.js) we published earlier. We are also publishing the [raw results](../res) for each of the solutions, except for the slow programs that still haven't completed. The files contain a lot more data than we could show in these tables. We encourage you to perform your own analysis of the raw data, and publish your findings.
