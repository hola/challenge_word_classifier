As promised, here are the final standings, with participants' names instead of submission IDs. Congratulations to the winners!

The jury is still out on who is going to receive the special prizes. Stay tuned for our follow-up post about the solutions that learn.

## Final standings

We received 603 submissions from 312 unique participants. Only the last submission from each participant was tested.

### Main standings table

Excluded from this table are submissions that crashed, hanged, or were too slow to complete testing.

Legend:

* **Correct**: correctness rate (this is what the competition is about)
* **F–**: rate of false negatives
* **F+**: rate of false positives
* **F+<sub>0</sub>**…**F+<sub>8</sub>**: rate of false positives among words generated from a particular model
* *hc*: submissions *hors concours* (off-contest)

Solutions that haven't been assigned a rank in the leftmost column of this table, were evaluated off-contest for several reasons, such as having been submitted by Hola employees or requiring a fix to run (author forgot the “gzip” checkbox when submitting).

| # | ID | Correct | F- | F+ | F+<sub>0</sub> | F+<sub>1</sub> | F+<sub>2</sub> | F+<sub>3</sub> | F+<sub>4</sub> | F+<sub>5</sub> | F+<sub>6</sub> | F+<sub>7</sub> | F+<sub>8</sub> |

### Slow solutions

Three solutions were too slow to be tested with 10,000 blocks in reasonable time. They have been tested on fewer blocks, so their results are approximate, and they could not be ranked precisely with the others. As of this writing, they are still running on one of our servers. If it doesn't need to reboot before the testing completes, these solutions will eventually be moved to the main table above. Note: these partial results have been updated since the previous post.

### Failing solutions

The remaining solutions failed in one way or another. With the exception of the two solutions that hang on a certain input, all crashes happened on initialization or first word classification attempt, and could have been prevented with the help of the [test program](../tests/test.js) we published during the contest.
