As promised, here are the final standings, with participants' names instead of submission IDs. Congratulations to the winners!

See also the [Russian version](https://habrahabr.ru/company/hola/blog/303660/) of this page.

The jury is still out on who is going to receive the special prizes. Stay tuned for our follow-up post about the solutions that learn.

## Final standings

We received 603 submissions from 312 unique participants. Only the last submission from each participant was tested.

### Main standings table

Excluded from this table are submissions that crashed, hanged, or were too slow to complete testing.

Legend:

* **Correct**: correctness rate (this is what the competition is about)
* **F–**: rate of false negatives
* **F+**: rate of false positives
* **F+<sub>0</sub>**…**F+<sub>8</sub>**: rate of false positives among words generated from a particular model
* *hc*: submissions *hors concours* (off-contest)

Solutions that haven't been assigned a rank in the leftmost column of this table, were evaluated off-contest for several reasons, such as having been submitted by Hola employees or requiring a fix to run (author forgot the “gzip” checkbox when submitting).

| # | ID | Correct | F- | F+ | F+<sub>0</sub> | F+<sub>1</sub> | F+<sub>2</sub> | F+<sub>3</sub> | F+<sub>4</sub> | F+<sub>5</sub> | F+<sub>6</sub> | F+<sub>7</sub> | F+<sub>8</sub> |

[Andrey Nedobylskiy](../submissions/57469a9263905b3a11d97bf0)'s solution was too slow to be tested with 10,000 blocks in a reasonable time. We managed to run it on 37% of the test sequence, which took over a month (checking a word took 8.5 seconds on average), until our server needed a maintenance restart. On the portion of the test sequence that it managed to complete, the correctness rate was 53.97%, which would place the solution at rank 217 in the table above.

### Failing solutions

The remaining solutions failed in one way or another. With the exception of the two solutions that hang on a certain input, all crashes happened on initialization or first word classification attempt, and could have been prevented with the help of the [test program](../tests/test.js) we published during the contest.
